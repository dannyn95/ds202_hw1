Data science is somewhat difficult for me to fully describe. However, I believe data science is the collecting, organizing, and analyzing of data by utilizing a combined set of skills and tools. One example involving this would be the weather. Various news stations gather weather data in order to make predictions about future weather patterns. Data science can apply to many other subjects besides weather as it is a growing field of study. For a more generalized idea of data science the following link can give an explanation with a venn-diagram specifying, "hacking skills, math and stats knowledge, and substantive expertise". http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram.
